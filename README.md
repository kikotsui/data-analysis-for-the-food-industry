# data-analysis-for-the-food-industry
To shed light on the factors influencing food expenditure, this project aims to
identify and analyze key variables such as GDP, CPI, and S&P 500. By using these
variables as explanatory factors, the project aims to provide insights that can help people
predict future food prices and enable the government to make informed decisions on
policies related to residents' food expenditures. My ultimate goal is to help ensure that
appropriate measures are taken to address any challenges that may arise in the food
market and to promote sustainable and affordable access to food for all.
